How to use:
1. I prefer Conda. Install a python 3.9 environment. Ask chat GPT how to do this it's very easy. https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/
2. Create and activate your conda environment
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Also install Jupyter Notebook (ask chat GPT if confused)
5. Launch with "jupyter notebook"
6. Create a notebook and at the top, do "from charts import *". Make sure charts.py is in the directory with your ipynb file.
